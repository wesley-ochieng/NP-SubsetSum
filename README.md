Project Structure
The entire solution is contained within the NP_Complete_Lab_Activity.ipynb Jupyter Notebook. The notebook is structured as follows:

Problem Analysis: Provides a formal definition of the Subset Sum problem, explains why it is NP-complete, and discusses its real-world applications.

Reduction Demonstration: Outlines the theoretical steps for performing a polynomial-time reduction from 3-SAT to Subset Sum.

Algorithm Implementation: Contains a Python function that solves the Subset Sum problem using a dynamic programming approach. It includes sample inputs and outputs to demonstrate correctness.

How to Run
Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your system.

Open the NP_Complete_Lab_Activity.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

You can run all cells to see the explanations and the output of the code implementation.
